# GitHub Profile Clone
GitHub Profile Clone
A responsive web application that mimics the GitHub user profile page, fetching and displaying real user data from the GitHub API.

Features
Real GitHub Data Integration: Fetches user profiles, repositories, and other public data directly from GitHub's API

Tabbed interface for different content sections (Overview, Repositories, Projects, etc.)

Search functionality to look up any GitHub user

Repository filtering and sorting options

Responsive Design: Works on all device sizes from mobile to desktop

Visualizations: Includes a contributions graph (mock data) using Chart.js

Accessibility: Built with ARIA labels and semantic HTML for better screen reader support

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Libraries:

Chart.js for data visualization

Font Awesome for icons

APIs: GitHub REST API

Installation
No installation required! Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

For development purposes:

Clone this repository

Open the project directory

Launch index.html in your browser

Usage

Limitations
The contributions graph uses mock data as GitHub's actual contribution data isn't publicly available via API

Pinned repositories are simulated by showing the most recently updated repositories

Rate limiting may occur with excessive GitHub API requests

Future Improvements
Add authentication to access private repositories

Implement pagination for repositories list

Add more visualizations (language usage, activity timeline)

Cache API responses for better performance
